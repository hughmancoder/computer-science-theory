The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. You can download the CSV from this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B_3ABybPrJKSkGJNSSJwctQijYOHcJZu/view)\n","\n","The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0: Angry, 1: Disgust, 2: Fear, 3: Happy, 4: Sad, 5: Surprise, 6: Neutral). The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the public test set consists of 3,589 examples.\n","\n","We provide baseline code that includes the following features:\n","\n","*   Loding and Analysing the FER-2013 dataset using torchvision.\n","*   Defining a simple convolutional neural network.\n","*   How to use existing loss function for the model learning.\n","*   Train the network on the training data.\n","*   Test the trained network on the testing data.\n","*   Generate prediction for the random test image(s).\n","\n","The following changes could be considered:\n","-------\n","1. Change of advanced training parameters: Learning Rate, Optimizer, Batch-size, Number of Max Epochs, and Drop-out.\n","2. Use of a new loss function.\n","3. Data augmentation\n","4. Architectural Changes: Batch Normalization, Residual layers, Attention Block, and other varients.\n","\n","Marking Rules:\n","-------\n","We will mark the competition based on the final test accuracy on testing images and your report.\n","\n","Final mark (out of 50) = acc_mark + efficiency mark + report mark\n","###Acc_mark 10:\n","\n","We will rank all the submission results based on their test accuracy. Zero improvement over the baseline yields 0 marks. Maximum improvement over the baseline will yield 10 marks. There will be a sliding scale applied in between.\n","\n","###Efficiency mark 10:\n","\n","Efficiency considers not only the accuracy, but the computational cost of running the model (flops: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS). Efficiency for our purposes is defined to be the ratio of accuracy (in %) to Gflops. Please report the computational cost for your final model and include the efficiency calculation in your report. Maximum improvement over the baseline will yield 10 marks. Zero improvement over the baseline yields zero marks, with a sliding scale in between.\n","\n","###Report mark 30:\n","Your report should comprise:\n","1. An introduction showing your understanding of the task and of the baseline model: [10 marks]\n","\n","2. A description of how you have modified aspects of the system to improve performance. [10 marks]\n","\n","A recommended way to present a summary of this is via an \"ablation study\" table, eg:\n","\n","|Method1|Method2|Method3|Accuracy|\n","|---|---|---|---|\n","|N|N|N|60%|\n","|Y|N|N|65%|\n","|Y|Y|N|77%|\n","|Y|Y|Y|82%|\n","\n","3.
