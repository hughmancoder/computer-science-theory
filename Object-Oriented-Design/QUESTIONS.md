# OO Problems

1. **Deck of Cards**: Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would subclass the data structures to implement blackjack.

2. **Call Center**: Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager, and director. Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method `dispatchCall()` which assigns a call to the first available employee.

3. **Jukebox**: Design a musical jukebox using object-oriented principles.

   - Hints: if 198

4. **Parking Lot**: Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles.

   - Hints: #258

5. **Online Book Reader**: Design the data structures for an online book reader system.

   - Hints: #344
   - Page reference: pg 307

6. **Jigsaw**: Implement an NxN jigsaw puzzle. Design the data structures and explain an algorithm to solve the puzzle. You can assume that you have a `fitsWith` method which, when passed two puzzle edges, returns true if the two edges belong together.

   - Hints: #192, #238, #283

7. **Chat Server**: Explain how you would design a chat server. In particular, provide details about the various backend components, classes, and methods. What would be the hardest problems to solve?

   - Hints: #213, #245, #271

8. **Othello**: Implement the object-oriented design for the game Othello.

   - Hints: #179, #228

9. **Circular Array**: Implement a `CircularArray` class that supports an array-like data structure which can be efficiently rotated. If possible, the class should use a generic type (also called a template), and should support iteration via the standard `for (Obj o : circularArray)` notation.

   - Hints: #389

10. **Minesweeper**: Design and implement a text-based Minesweeper game.

- Hints: #351, #361, #377, #386, #399

11. **File System**: Explain the data structures and algorithms that you would use to design an in-memory file system. Illustrate with an example in code where possible.

- Hints: #141, #216
- Page reference: pg 337

12. **Hash Table**: Design and implement a hash table which uses chaining (linked lists) to handle collisions.

- Hints: #287, #307
