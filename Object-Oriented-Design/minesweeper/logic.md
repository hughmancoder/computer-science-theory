## About

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game that involves uncovering cells in a grid without triggering hidden mines. The logic behind Minesweeper revolves around these key elements:

## Grid Initialization

Grid Creation: The game starts with a grid of cells, typically rectangular. The size of the grid can vary, affecting the game's difficulty.

Mine Placement: A predetermined number of mines are randomly placed in different cells of the grid. The number of mines is usually a key factor in the game's difficulty level.

Calculating Adjacent Mines: For each cell on the grid that is not a mine, the game calculates the number of mines in the adjacent cells (including diagonals). This count is crucial for gameplay, as it provides hints to the player about where mines are located.

## Gameplay Mechanics

Opening Cells: The main action in Minesweeper is opening a cell. When a player chooses a cell, one of three things happens:

If the cell contains a mine, the game is over.
If the cell does not contain a mine, it shows a number indicating how many adjacent cells contain mines.
If the cell does not contain a mine and has no adjacent mines, it reveals an empty cell, and typically, the game automatically opens adjacent cells until cells with non-zero mine counts are reached.
Flagging Cells: Players can flag cells that they suspect contain mines. This is a way to keep track of where they think mines are and avoid accidentally opening these cells. Flagged cells cannot be opened unless they are unflagged.

## Win/Lose Conditions

Losing the Game: The game is lost if a player opens a cell containing a mine.

Winning the Game: The game is won when all cells without mines are opened. Some variations of the game also require the player to flag all the mines correctly.

Strategies:
Basic Strategy: Use the numbers revealed by opened cells to deduce which unopened cells are safe to open next.
Advanced Strategy: Involves probability and more complex logical deduction, especially in situations where there is not enough information to be certain and players must make educated guesses.
