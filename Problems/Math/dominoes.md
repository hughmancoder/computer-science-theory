# Dominoes

We have 62 squares with row 1 and 7 having 7 squares

For each row we will always have one dominoe that will need to poke into the next row no matter the palcement

Proof:

We have 30 white squares and 32 black squares.

Each dominoes must take up one white and one black square however given
placements we can take up at most 30 white and black squares therefore it is impossible to fill the 2
remaining squares so placement remains impossible
