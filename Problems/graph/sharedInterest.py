    This function takes a graph of friends who have different interests and determines which groups of friends have the most interests in common.
    It then multiplies the friends_nodes of the resulting node pairs and returns the maximal product.

    Parameters:
    friends_nodes (int): The number of nodes in the graph.
    friends_edges (int): The number of edges in the graph.
    friends_from (list): A list of integers representing the starting nodes of the edges.
    friends_to (list): A list of integers representing the ending nodes of the edges.
    friends_weight (list): A list of integers representing the weights of the edges.

    Returns:
    int: The maximal product of the friends_nodes of the node pairs with the maximum number of shared interests.

Explanation 0
Each pair of n = 4 friends is connected by the following Interest:

Pair (1, 2) shares 2 Interest (i.e., Interest 1 and 2)
Pair (1, 3) shares 1 Interest (i.e., Interest 1)
Pair (1, 4) shares 0 Interest
Pair (2, 3) shares 2 Interest (i.e., Interest 1 and 3)
Pair (2, 4) shares 1 Interest (i.e., Interest 3)
Pair (3, 4) shares 1 Interest (i.e., Interest 3)

The pairs connected by the maximal number of Interest are (1, 2) and (2, 3). Their respective products are 1 × 2 = 2 and 2 × 3 = 6. We then return the largest of these values as our answer, which is 6.
