## Algorithms and Data Structures

- Algorithms and Data Structures are implemented in C++
- Design patterns are implemented in Java from the textbook Head First Design Patterns (O'Reilly second edition)

## Design patterns

## OO basics

Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by representing only the essential features, hiding the implementation details. It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, making it easier to understand and use.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on that data within a single unit, known as a class. It hides the internal implementation of an object and allows access to its functionality through well-defined interfaces, promoting better code organization and security.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the use of a single interface to represent a group of related objects, making the code more flexible and extensible. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (subclass) acquires the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass). It promotes code reuse and enables the creation of hierarchies in which subclasses inherit characteristics from their parent classes, forming an "is-a" relationship.

## OO Principles

Encapsulate what varies

Favor composition over inheretance

Program to intefaces not implementation
