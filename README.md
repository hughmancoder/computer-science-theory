Concepts from undegraduate computer science and additional learning

## Contents

- **Algorithms-And-Data-Structures**: This section includes implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structures. Key topics include disjoint-set operations, hash tables, linked lists, minimum spanning trees, advanced multiplication techniques, path finding, and implementations of queues, sorting algorithms, stacks, and tree data structures.

- **Artificial-Intelligence**: This area focuses on various algorithms and methods used in the field of AI. It includes implementations and resources related to Hidden Markov Models, K-Means Clustering, KD-trees, and Support Vector Machines.

- **Computer-Systems**: This section delves into the lower-level aspects of computer science, such as Assembly programming and a Virtual Machine Parser. It provides practical examples and test cases to understand assembly language and the workings of virtual machines.

- **Design-Patterns**: Dedicated to software engineering design patterns, this section contains examples and implementations of various design patterns like Factory, Mediator, Singleton, and Strategy, with specific examples in Java demonstrating their usage and benefits.
