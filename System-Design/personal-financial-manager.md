## About

A personal financial manager is a tool that helps users manage their finances. It connects to users' bank accounts, analyzes their spending habits, and provides recommendations to improve their financial health. The goal of this system is to provide a comprehensive view of a user's financial situation and help them make informed decisions.

## Design considerations

Data Integration: The system needs to securely connect to various financial institutions to gather users' financial data. This can be achieved using APIs provided by the financial institutions.

Data Analysis: The system needs to analyze the financial data to understand the user's spending habits. This could involve categorizing transactions, calculating spending in each category, and identifying trends over time.

Recommendations: Based on the analysis, the system should provide personalized recommendations to the user. This could involve suggesting ways to reduce spending, identifying investment opportunities, or providing advice on budgeting. A demand forcasting algorithm could be used or more complex ai recommendations such as using neural networks for more subtle suggesitons. A simple approach might be to take the average amount spent in each category over the last 3 months and suggest that as the budget for the next month for a given category.

Security and Privacy: Given the sensitive nature of financial data, the system needs to ensure that the data is stored and transmitted securely. It also needs to respect the user's privacy and only use the data for the purposes that the user has consented to.

Data collection: The system needs to collect financial data from the user's bank accounts. This data can be collected from the bank's website using web scraping. The data needs to be collected in real-time (as each transaction occurs) or in batches (e.g., every hour or every day depending on how much traffic the website gets). Every day would be a great option.
We could use a categoriser to map seller names and categories to user groupings. We can take transactions from sellers at the end of a batch time period and then map it into a given users categories. We can then use this to calculate the average spending in each category over the last 3 months and suggest that as the budget for the next month for a given categor for a user
